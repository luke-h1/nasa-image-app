# nasa-image-app



## run locally 
  * if you want to run this App locally, request an API key from here: https://api.nasa.gov/ and add it to the API_KEY literal in app.js  

  
  
 ## TODO: 
  * add turnary operator to use the non-hd image url if the API doesn't return the 'hdurl' in the response  
  * setup vercel.json to hide API key instead of just using the DEMO_KEY when deployed
